More than 3 months since my last blog post. One 45-day Eurotrip in the middle.
My trip was superb. However, I had no time to work on these side projects.
Now that I'm back home, it's time to do some planning again and put some short-term
milestones to gain momentum, now towards the end of the year.

So, 3 months have passed since I started this journey and I have launched zero products by now.

### Plin no longer one of 12 products

Right after my surgery, I made the decision to exclude the project Plin from this
list of 12 products. The reason behind this is that the project doesn't depend
on me alone, it's a shared idea and vision with a close friend. It was clear to me
that I cannot drag another person into this crazy journey of mine. I will keep working
on it, it's just that progress will not be tracked on this blog as part of one of the
12 products to launch in 12 months.

### 9 months to go

One "loophole" of this "12 products in 12 months" strategy is that it doesn't
mean that I have to release 1 product each month. I just have to have released 12
products after 12 months. Although now I have to release 12 products in 9 months.
Actually, my current goal is to release the first product as soon as possible.

An idea that circled back to me as a potential product is offering development services
and consulting by hour. I already have a website for this, I'll have to work on SEO and marketing and start landing clients.
