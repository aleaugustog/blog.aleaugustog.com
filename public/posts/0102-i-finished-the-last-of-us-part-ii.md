The following is a spoiler-free blog post. Last weekend I finished playing The Last of Us Part II. I’m a big fan of the first video game and when the second part came out I just had gotten my PS4 and I was more than ready for it.

By that time, it had been a few years since I last played the original game (I played it twice including the Left Behind expansion) so I decided to refresh my memory and enter in TLOU state of mind by playing the first game again. I did and it was amazing again.

I think it was early 2021 when I started playing Part II but work and life stuff kept me from continue playing it. Life happened.

Then, the TV series came out and that’s when I said “now it’s time to play Part II before the second season of the TV show comes out”. Still, no progress.

Then, the second season of the TV show came out and it became my punishment for not playing the game before to let the show spoil it for me.

Finally, a few weeks ago I guess I put my “outside-of-work” life together and started playing it, with my wife as my companion.

I won’t talk about the story, to avoid spoilers, but I do have praises about the game from the artistic and technical POV. I believe that the development of this game is an epic work of engineering. The world is much more expanded that in the first video game, if that’s possible, at the same time that it keeps the perfect artistic illustration.

Story-telling, probably the strongest aspect in the first game, it’s even more mind-blowing in this one. At the point that you can find so many contrasted opinions about the story online. Like in the first game, it hits right at the center of: life is made up of gray areas, not everything is black and white.

Gameplay is very exciting as well. The only aspect of the story I’m going to mention is that you play the game with two characters. And it’s super cool how you can feel the difference in styles of attack, combat, resource-gathering and gun-modding between the two characters.

In summary, if you haven’t played it, please go and play it. Don’t pospone it. I’m pretty sure there’s remastered versions of both games for PS5, in case you haven’t played the first one either (boy, you’re in for a treat).
