Today my blog went live! I've been working on this for a couple of weeks,
one appendicitis in the middle, and now it's finally live.

I tried to keep things simple by using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
I'm using Markdown files as blog posts storage.
I also made the [blog's GitHub repo public](https://github.com/thytanium/blog.aleaugustog.com)
so anyone can check it out. Or reuse it.

You can checkout the [home page](/) and learn about my venture **Launching 12 products in 12 months**.
