Last month, I started a personal goal to release 12 side project ideas in 12 months.
I have a -somewhat- long list of side project ideas that I've sworn myself to
take to the finish line, but I have never been able to.
Some of these are still just ideas, and others became projects that are now abandoned.
Not anymore!

---

The inspiration comes from [Başak's tweet](https://twitter.com/hellobasak/status/1676909154437414912) about the same idea.

The idea is to work on 1 product for a whole month, for 12 months. No matter what happens,
after a month, that product will be released. This helps me to keep focused on
what is really important and to keep perfectionist me at bay.

Of course, I won't release something that is not working. But that's actually the point.
The strict goal and my perfectionism will create a combination that I think will always make a usable product.

To begin, I came up with a spreadsheet where I keep these ideas and where I try to keep
track of the amount of time/effort I invest on each idea compared to their profit.

One interesting sceneario that I know will come up is that after releasing the first product,
I will start working on the second product while making changes and improvements to the first product.
Then, when the second product is released, I will starting working on the third product while making
changes and improvements on the first 2 products. So, after 1 year, I'll be working on 12 products
at the same time. _Insane_.

I honestly don't know what I'm going to do when that happens, but I need it to happen so I can start
worrying about it. The goal: making this problem become true.

For now, this is my release plan for the first 3 products:

| Codename    | Release date |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Plin        | 2023-08-01   |
| Sprintdroid | 2023-09-01   |
| Cloudemica  | 2023-09-28   |

I will not get into details about what each codename and product is actually about.
One detail worth sharing is that these 3 initial ideas are SaaS products.

### Time and Money

It's important to remark that, unlike Başak, I do have a full-time job.
And I plan to keep it like that at least for now. Meaning: I'll work my full-time job
and work on side product ideas either before or after my "work day".
Plus weekends and holidays.

I guess I'm not brave enough yet to resign my full-time job and make this my only focus.
In the other hand, however,
I also don't have that big of a runway of saved money to live of in the meantime.
I have personal goals for which I need to save up money every month.

### The blog

One of things I noticed while working on my first product was that I needed
to have a conversation with myself to collect my thoughts about what happened on that day.
Or what happened since the last time I had this conversation with myself.
Some people might call this meditating. I'm calling it _retrospectives_.

A retrospective goes very similar to a [Scrum Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective).

Until this point you might have to started worrying about me. Poor Alejandro talking to himself.
Well, I'm not. I hold these retrospective "meetings with myself" by typing my thoughts in a
Google Docs document.

First, I make a summary of the time spent in side products during the period.
I'm using [Toggl](https://toggl.com) to track my time.

Then, I focus on answering 3 questions:

- What to _keep_ doing
- What to _stop_ doing
- What to _start_ doing

These retrospectives became very helpful to identify where I was wasting time.

In one of these retrospectives, I was hit with the idea that I could publish these documents publicly,
even if nobody cares to read them, to help me with [accountability](https://www.thedesigncoach.com.au/post/the-magic-of-accountability).

**And that's how this blog was born**. I'll write about my findings in the retrospective conversations
and tech challenges that I find in my way that could be interesting to share.
