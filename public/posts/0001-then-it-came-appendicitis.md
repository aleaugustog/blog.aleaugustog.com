So, last Monday night I was feeling some stomach pains and I went to the ER.
I didn't think it was too serious because I've had different kinds of stomach problems in my life.
In fact, I'm pretty sure I've ONLY been in ERs in my life due to stomach issues.
So I went to the ER expecting to be diagnosed gastritis or something like that, get
some pain meds and go home on a diet.

As it turns out, it was more serious than that. I was diagnosed appendicitis.
I've never had surgery in my life, so this was my first.
Luckily, they caught it early. It was good that I went to ER immediately.
I underwent surgery the next day and was allowed to go home the day after.
It's been a week since the surgery. I've had limited computer time in the last week.

### Regarding the "One project per month" project

First things first: I was behind schedule already on the Plin project.
The surgery works well as an excuse to buy more time to have the Plin project in a more "MVP" state.

So I had to go back and take a good look at the calendar. The plan I came up with is the following:

| Project     | Old release date | New release date |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Plin        | 2023-08-07       | 2023-09-01       |
| Sprintdroid | 2023-09-01       | 2023-09-28       |
| Cloudemica  | 2023-09-28       | 2023-12-15       |

**Note**: The "late" release date for Cloudemica (almost 3 months after the previous release)
is due to the fact that I'll be traveling 44 days through Europe during the whole month of October and half of November.
So, the start date for Cloudemica will be around 2023-11-15.

I'll do my best to seize opportunities to work on any time slot that frees up during my trip.
For example, during train or plane rides.
